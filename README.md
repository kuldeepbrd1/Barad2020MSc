Resources for CNN-based spacecraft navigation around uncooperative spacecraft.


- Keypoint Detection: [HRNet (adapted)](https://github.com/kuldeepbrd1/HRNet-spacecraft-pose)
- Object Detection: [Tensorflow OD API MobileNet-SSDLite (adapted)](https://github.com/kuldeepbrd1/models) (needs updating)
- Pose Estimation: [Modified MLPnP solver](https://github.com/kuldeepbrd1/modified_MLPnP)
- Dataset Augmentation ...
- Filter ...

Other links will be updated as soon as I stop distracting myself with a dozen unfinished projects. 

Meanwhile you can explore the resources from my [repositories](https://github.com/kuldeepbrd1?tab=repositories)


----- 
To do:
- [ ] Verify code generalization for spacecraft pose estimation in HRNet and SSDLite
- [ ] Update Tensorflow OD API repo from drive
- [ ] Add Colab notebooks
- [ ] Data pipeline files
- [ ] Add dataset augmentation code
- [ ] Notes/Resources?
